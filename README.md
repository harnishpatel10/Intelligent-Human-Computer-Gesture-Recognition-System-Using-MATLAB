# Intelligent-Human-Computer-Gesture-Recognition-System-Using-MATLAB
This project is based on Gesture recognition based on sEMG signals. We have developed a
reliable and effective gesture recognition system to develop a good Human-Machine interface.
We have used Datasets for the acquisition of sEMG signals which consists the data of Seven
Hand Gestures. Then we have split the dataset for Cross-validation. We have kept 70% training
data and 30% testing data. Furthermore, we have kept 5-Fold cross validation K-folds to
evaluate the classification in classifier. We have used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classification method. At least we have compared the
Accuracies and Error between both the classification method. We have performed this on 6
different data sets.
